# Mix Upload Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issues Fixed:

### 1. Missing Database Columns

- **Problem**: `albumArtS3Key` and `albumArtUrl` columns were missing from the `DjMix` table
- **Solution**: Created and applied migration `20250817172602_add_album_art_columns`

### 2. AWS S3 Configuration Missing

- **Problem**: Upload was failing because AWS credentials weren't configured
- **Solution**: Added fallback to local file storage when AWS is not configured

### 3. Album Art Upload Not Handled

- **Problem**: MixUpload component was sending album art but API wasn't processing it
- **Solution**: Updated upload route to handle album art files

## ✅ Current Status:

- **Mix Upload**: ✅ Working with local file storage
- **Album Art Upload**: ✅ Working with local file storage
- **Database Schema**: ✅ Up to date with all required columns
- **File Storage**:
  - Mixes: `/app/public/uploads/mixes/`
  - Album Art: `/app/public/uploads/album-art/`

## 🎵 How to Test:

1. **Login as a DJ** (use seeded accounts)
2. **Upload a mix** with or without album art
3. **Files will be saved locally** in the container
4. **Check Prisma Studio** at http://localhost:5555 to see the uploaded data

## 🚀 For Production (AWS S3):

When ready to use S3:

```bash
# Run AWS setup script
./setup-aws.sh

# This will configure:
# - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# - AWS_REGION
# - AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
```

## 📁 File Structure:

```
/app/public/uploads/
├── mixes/          # Audio files
└── album-art/      # Album art images
```

## 🔧 Files Modified:

- `app/api/mixes/upload/route.ts` - Added local storage fallback and album art handling
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Already had correct schema
- `prisma/migrations/` - Added new migration for album art columns
- `setup-aws.sh` - Created AWS configuration script

## 🎉 Result:

Mix uploads now work perfectly in development mode with local file storage!
