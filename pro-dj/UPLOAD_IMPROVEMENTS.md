# Upload Improvements Summary

## 🎯 Issues Fixed:

### 1. Modal Closing and Navigation

- **Problem**: Upload modal wasn't closing and navigating to mixes page after successful upload
- **Solution**:
  - Added `onClose?.()` call after successful upload
  - Added navigation to `/mixes` page after 500ms delay
  - Fixed prop name mismatch (`onUploadSuccess` → `onUploadComplete`)

### 2. Album Art Display

- **Problem**: Album art wasn't showing up in the audio player
- **Solution**:
  - Added debugging logs to track album art URL handling
  - Verified album art URL construction in upload route
  - Album art files are saved to `/app/public/uploads/album-art/`

## ✅ Current Status:

- **Modal Behavior**: ✅ Closes and navigates to mixes page after upload
- **Album Art Upload**: ✅ Working (files saved locally)
- **Album Art Display**: 🔍 Debugging added to track URL handling

## 🧪 Testing Instructions:

### 1. Test Upload with Album Art:

1. **Login as a DJ**
2. **Upload a mix** with album art
3. **Check console logs** for album art URL debugging
4. **Verify modal closes** and navigates to mixes page
5. **Check if album art appears** in the audio player

### 2. Check File Storage:

```bash
# Check if album art files are being created
docker exec pro-dj-app-dev ls -la /app/public/uploads/album-art/

# Check if mix files are being created
docker exec pro-dj-app-dev ls -la /app/public/uploads/mixes/
```

### 3. Check Database:

```bash
# Check mix records with album art
docker exec pro-dj-postgres-dev psql -U pro_dj_user -d pro_dj_dev -c "SELECT title, \"albumArtUrl\" FROM \"DjMix\" WHERE \"albumArtUrl\" IS NOT NULL;"
```

## 🔧 Files Modified:

- `components/MixUpload.tsx` - Added modal closing and navigation
- `app/mixes/page.tsx` - Fixed prop name for upload callback
- `components/WaveformPlayer.tsx` - Added debugging for album art URL

## 🎵 Expected Behavior:

1. **Upload Process**:

   - Select mix file
   - Optionally select album art
   - Fill in details
   - Click upload
   - See progress bar
   - Success message appears
   - Modal closes automatically
   - Redirects to mixes page

2. **Album Art Display**:
   - Album art should appear in the audio player
   - If no album art, shows music icon
   - Console logs will show album art URL handling

## 🐛 Debugging:

If album art still doesn't show:

1. **Check browser console** for album art URL logs
2. **Verify file exists** in container
3. **Check URL accessibility** by visiting the album art URL directly
4. **Verify database** has correct album art URL

## 🚀 Next Steps:

- Test upload with album art
- Monitor console logs
- Verify album art display
- Remove debugging logs once confirmed working
