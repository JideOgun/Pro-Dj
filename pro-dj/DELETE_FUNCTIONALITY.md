# Delete Functionality Improvements

## 🎯 Issues Fixed:

### 1. Missing Delete Authorization Data

- **Problem**: The mixes API wasn't returning `djId` and `userId` needed for authorization checks
- **Solution**: Updated API to include `dj.id` and `dj.userId` in the response

### 2. Incorrect Authorization Logic

- **Problem**: Frontend was checking `mix.djId` but the field was actually `mix.dj.userId`
- **Solution**: Fixed authorization logic to use `mix.dj.userId === session.user.id`

### 3. Delete Button Visibility

- **Problem**: Delete buttons were hidden by default and only showed on hover
- **Solution**: Made delete buttons always visible and added a more prominent delete button

## ✅ Current Status:

- **Authorization**: ✅ Only mix owners and admins can delete mixes
- **Delete Buttons**: ✅ Always visible for authorized users
- **Confirmation**: ✅ Improved confirmation dialog with mix title
- **Success Feedback**: ✅ Shows success message after deletion

## 🔐 Authorization Rules:

### Who Can Delete Mixes:

1. **Mix Owner**: The DJ who uploaded the mix
2. **Admin**: Any user with ADMIN role

### Authorization Check:

```typescript
const canDeleteMix = (mix: DjMix) => {
  if (!session?.user) return false;
  if (session.user.role === "ADMIN") return true;
  if (session.user.role === "DJ") {
    return mix.dj.userId === session.user.id;
  }
  return false;
};
```

## 🎨 UI Improvements:

### 1. Small Delete Button

- Located in the mix info bar
- Red trash icon
- Always visible (removed opacity-0)

### 2. Prominent Delete Button

- Full "Delete Mix" button below mix info
- Red background with icon and text
- More noticeable for users

### 3. Improved Confirmation

- Shows mix title in confirmation dialog
- Clear warning about permanent deletion
- Success message after deletion

## 🔧 Files Modified:

- `app/api/mixes/route.ts` - Added `dj.id` and `dj.userId` to response
- `app/mixes/page.tsx` - Fixed authorization logic and improved UI
- `app/api/mixes/[id]/route.ts` - Already had proper backend authorization

## 🧪 Testing Instructions:

### 1. Test as Mix Owner:

1. **Login as a DJ** who has uploaded mixes
2. **Go to mixes page**
3. **Verify delete buttons appear** on your own mixes
4. **Click delete button**
5. **Confirm deletion**
6. **Verify mix is removed** from the list

### 2. Test as Admin:

1. **Login as admin**
2. **Go to mixes page**
3. **Verify delete buttons appear** on all mixes
4. **Test deleting any mix**

### 3. Test as Regular User:

1. **Login as a regular user**
2. **Go to mixes page**
3. **Verify no delete buttons appear** on any mixes

### 4. Test Authorization:

1. **Login as DJ A**
2. **Try to delete DJ B's mix** (should not be possible)
3. **Verify no delete buttons** on other DJs' mixes

## 🎵 Expected Behavior:

### For Mix Owners:

- ✅ Delete buttons visible on their mixes
- ✅ Can delete their own mixes
- ✅ Confirmation dialog shows mix title
- ✅ Success message after deletion

### For Admins:

- ✅ Delete buttons visible on all mixes
- ✅ Can delete any mix
- ✅ Same confirmation and success flow

### For Other Users:

- ❌ No delete buttons visible
- ❌ Cannot delete any mixes

## 🚀 Next Steps:

- Test delete functionality with different user roles
- Verify authorization is working correctly
- Test edge cases (deleting last mix, etc.)
- Consider adding undo functionality if needed
