## üîß **Technical Testing**

### **Database Verification**

Check that account status is stored correctly:

```sql
-- Check user account status
SELECT
  email,
  status,
  suspendedAt,
  suspendedBy,
  suspensionReason
FROM "User"
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';

-- Check agreement status
SELECT
  email,
  agreedToTerms,
  agreedToPrivacy,
  termsAgreedAt,
  privacyAgreedAt
FROM "User"
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';
```

### **API Endpoint Testing**

Test the account management API endpoints:

```bash
# Get account status
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/user/account \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"

# Pause account
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user/account \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -d '{"action": "pause"}'

# Reactivate account
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user/account \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -d '{"action": "reactivate"}'

# Delete account
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/user/account \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"
```

### **Terms Agreement API Testing**

```bash
# Get agreement status
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth/agree-terms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"

# Submit agreement
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/agree-terms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -d '{"agreedToTerms": true, "agreedToPrivacy": true}'
```
